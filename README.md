# ReactJS

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Why Use ReactJS?

- To build interactive and efficient user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
- It is modular, declarative, and performance-oriented.

## If It's a JavaScript Library, Why Not Use JavaScript Instead?

1. **React is written in JavaScript and is primarily used for building user interfaces.**
   - It provides a structured way to manage and update the UI of web applications.
   - React is JavaScript code but introduces specific concepts and abstractions such as JSX (JavaScript XML) and component-based architecture to make it easier to create complex user interfaces.
   
2. **JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used for web development, allowing web browsers to be interactive.**
   - JavaScript is not only used for UI; it is also used for handling server-side logic, interacting with APIs, and performing data processing.

# Why Use React.js Over Plain JavaScript

## 1. Component-Based Architecture
React allows you to break down your UI into reusable and manageable components. This makes it easier to develop and maintain complex user interfaces.

## 2. Reusability
React enables you to create reusable UI components, making it easier to maintain and extend your code base.

## 3. Efficient UI Updates
React's virtual DOM minimizes unnecessary DOM manipulations, resulting in better performance for UI rendering.

## 4. Declarative Syntax
React provides a more declarative syntax for building UIs, making it easier to understand and reason about your code.

## 5. Community and Ecosystem
React has a large and active community with a wealth of libraries and tools to simplify state management and other aspects of development.

## 6. State Management
React provides mechanisms for managing the state of your application effectively, which is crucial for building interactive and data-driven UIs. While React has its own local state management, it can also be used with external state management libraries like Redux.

## 7. Development Speed
React's component-based architecture and reusable components significantly speed up development time.

## 8. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
React can be used for server-side rendering, which improves SEO, a challenge to achieve with plain JavaScript.

## 9. Cross-Platform Development
React is not only used for web development but also for iOS and Android mobile app development through React Native.

## 10. Compatibility
React is highly compatible with other libraries and frameworks, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.


# JSX - JavaScript Extension Syntax

- It lets us write HTML directly inside JS.
- JSX is converted to JS by using Babel JavaScript Compiler.

# Set up Local Environment

## Create-React-App vs. Vite

### Why prefer Vite over Create-React-App?
1. Faster spin-up of the development server.
2. Less waiting time for reflecting file updates.
3. Improved build performance.
4. Rich features.

### Commands to get started with Vite
- `npm create vite@latest`
- `npm run dev` // to start the server
