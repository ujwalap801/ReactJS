Imperative vs Declarative 
Imperative = Explaining each Step
Imperative Programming as the name suggests is a type of programming paradigm that describes how the program executes. Developers are more concerned with how to get an answer step by step. It comprises the sequence of command imperatives.


Declarative :
Declarative Programming as the name suggests is a type of programming paradigm that describes what programs to be executed. Developers are more concerned with the answer that is received. It declares what kind of results we want and leave programming language aside focusing on simply figuring out how to produce them. In simple words, it mainly focuses on end result.  

Both ReactJS and Angular JS are declarative

ReactJS is a Js Library(Medium level applications we use)
ReactJS Examples: Facebook,Insta,Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox
Angular JS is a jS framework(Enterprise level Applications)
Ex:Gmail, Google drive, ectc
Vue JS s a framework

A single-page application (SPA) is a modern way to build apps, like the ones Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others use. SPAs are like apps that run in our web browser, and they donâ€™t need to reload the whole page when we use them.

A multiple-page application (MPA) is a more traditional approach to app development. With MPAs, every time we want to see something new, the whole web page has to reload. E-commerce companies with lots of products often prefer this approach.


By using ReactJS we can create SPA applications


install node js
npx create-react-app my-app 
or
npm create vite@latest

src- all source code inside it 
index.html- Main page (inside src)
App.jsx= route component of react application

All reactjs, angular follows component based Architectre


Components:They let u split the UI into independent, reusable pieces
Every component must return React Element
